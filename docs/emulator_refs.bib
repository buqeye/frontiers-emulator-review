Indeed, there exists an unprecedented availability of high-fidelity measurements from time-series recordings, numerical simulations, and experimental data. When data is coupled with readily available algorithms and innovations in machine (statistical) learning, it is possible to extract meaningful spatiotemporal patterns that dominate dynamic activity. A direct implication of such data-driven modeling strategies is that we can gain traction on understanding fundamental scientific processes and also enhance our capabilities for prediction, state estimation, and control of complex systems. The ability to discover underlying principles from data has been called the fourth paradigm of scientific discovery [131]. Mathematical techniques geared toward characterizing patterns in data and capitalizing on the observed low-dimensional structures fall clearly within this fourth paradigm and are in ever-growing demand.}

  abstract = {Deep learning-based reduced order models (DL-ROMs) have been recently proposed to overcome common limitations shared by conventional reduced order models (ROMs) – built, e.g., through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) – when applied to nonlinear time-dependent parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs). These might be related to (i) the need to deal with projections onto high dimensional linear approximating trial manifolds, (ii) expensive hyper-reduction strategies, or (iii) the intrinsic difficulty to handle physical complexity with a linear superimposition of modes. All these aspects are avoided when employing DL-ROMs, which learn in a non-intrusive way both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics, by relying on deep (e.g., feedforward, convolutional, autoencoder) neural networks. Although extremely efficient at testing time, when evaluating the PDE solution for any new testing-parameter instance, DL-ROMs require an expensive training stage, because of the extremely large number of network parameters to be estimated. In this paper we propose a possible way to avoid an expensive training stage of DL-ROMs, by (i) performing a prior dimensionality reduction through POD, and (ii) relying on a multi-fidelity pretraining stage, where different physical models can be efficiently combined. The proposed POD-DL-ROM is tested on several (both scalar and vector, linear and nonlinear) time-dependent parametrized PDEs (such as, e.g., linear advection–diffusion–reaction, nonlinear diffusion–reaction, nonlinear elastodynamics, and Navier–Stokes equations) to show the generality of this approach and its remarkable computational savings.}

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

  abstract = {The Reduced Basis Method (RBM) is a rigorous model reduction approach for solving parameterizedpartial differential equations. It identifies a low-dimensional subspace for approximation of the parametric solution manifold that is embedded in high-dimensional space. A reduced order model is subsequently constructed in this subspace. RBM relies on residual-based error indicators or a posteriori error bounds to guide construction of the reduced solution subspace, to serve as a stopping criteria, and to certify the resulting surrogate solutions. Unfortunately, it is well-known that the standard algorithm for residual norm computation suffers from premature stagnation at the level of the square root of machine precision. In this paper, we develop two alternatives to the standard offline phase of reduced basis algorithms. First, we design a robust strategy for computation of residual error indicators that allows RBM algorithms to enrich the solution subspace with accuracy beyond root machine precision. Secondly, we propose a new error indicator based on the Lebesgue function in interpolation theory. This error indicator does not require computation of residual norms, and instead only requires the ability to compute the RBM solution. This residual-free indicator is rigorous in that it bounds the error committed by the RBM approximation, but up to an uncomputable multiplicative constant. Because of this, the residual-free indicator is effective in choosing snapshots during the offline RBM phase, but cannot currently be used to certify error that the approximation commits. However, it circumvents the need for a posteriori analysis of numerical methods, and therefore can be effective on problems where such a rigorous estimate is hard to derive.}

  abstract = {A reduced basis method based on a physics-informed machine learning framework is developed for efficient reduced-order modeling of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs). A feedforward neural network is used to approximate the mapping from the time-parameter to the reduced coefficients. During the offline stage, the network is trained by minimizing the weighted sum of the residual loss of the reduced-order equations, and the data loss of the labeled reduced coefficients that are obtained via the projection of high-fidelity snapshots onto the reduced space. Such a network is referred to as physics-reinforced neural network (PRNN). As the number of residual points in time-parameter space can be very large, an accurate network – referred to as physics-informed neural network (PINN) – can be trained by minimizing only the residual loss. However, for complex nonlinear problems, the solution of the reduced-order equation is less accurate than the projection of high-fidelity solution onto the reduced space. Therefore, the PRNN trained with the snapshot data is expected to have higher accuracy than the PINN. Numerical results demonstrate that the PRNN is more accurate than the PINN and a purely data-driven neural network for complex problems. During the reduced basis refinement, the PRNN may obtain higher accuracy than the direct reduced-order model based on a Galerkin projection. The online evaluation of PINN/PRNN is orders of magnitude faster than that of the Galerkin reduced-order model.}

  abstract = { This article reviews theory and applications of Koopman modes in fluid mechanics. Koopman mode decomposition is based on the surprising fact, discovered in Mezić (2005), that normal modes of linear oscillations have their natural analogs—Koopman modes—in the context of nonlinear dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the representation of the system from the state-space representation to the dynamics governed by the linear Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper dealt only with measure-preserving transformations, the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The analysis is based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of computation of the spectrum and the associated Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic observable, this method uncovers the full point spectrum. A computational alternative is given by Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and differences between these two methods. A number of applications are reviewed in which decompositions of this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory unifies and provides a rigorous background for a number of different concepts that have been advanced in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis, triple decomposition, and dynamic mode decomposition. }

  abstract = {Abstract For general non-linear parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs), the standard Galerkin projection is no longer efficient to generate reduced-order models. This is because the evaluation of the integrals involving the non-linear terms has a high computational complexity and cannot be pre-computed. This situation also occurs for linear equations when the parametric dependence is nonaffine. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to generate reduced-order models for large-scale systems derived from PDEs, which may involve non-linear terms and nonaffine parametric dependence. The main idea is to replace the non-linear and nonaffine terms with a coefficient-function approximation consisting of a linear combination of pre-computed basis functions with parameter-dependent coefficients. The coefficients are determined efficiently by an inexpensive and stable interpolation at some pre-computed points. The efficiency and accuracy of this method are demonstrated on several test cases, which show significant computational savings relative to the standard Galerkin projection reduced-order approach.

The GPR is carried out in the offline stage with active data selection, and the outputs for new parameter values can be obtained rapidly as probabilistic distributions during the online stage. Due to the complete decoupling of the offline and online stages, the proposed non-intrusive RB method provides a powerful tool to efficiently solve parametrized nonlinear problems with various engineering applications requiring multi-query or real-time evaluations. With both geometric and material nonlinearities taken into account, numerical results are presented for typical 1D and 3D examples, illustrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.}

This subtlety can have undesirable effects. I present a formulation of Hamilton's principle that is compatible with initial value problems. Remarkably, this leads to a natural formulation for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of generic non-conservative systems, thereby filling a long-standing gap in classical mechanics. Thus dissipative effects, for example, can be studied with new tools that may have application in a variety of disciplines. The new formalism is demonstrated by two examples of non-conservative systems: an object moving in a fluid with viscous drag forces and a harmonic oscillator coupled to a dissipative environment.}

The variational calculus used is consistent with an initial value formulation of physical problems and allows for time-irreversible processes, such as dissipation, to be included at the level of the action. In this formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a nonconservative action \mathcal{S}S, which is a functional of a doubled set of degrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a potential KK which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a nonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open system interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out or coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize Noether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer conserved when KK is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects of a physical system are derived solely from KK. We show how to use the formalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems including forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction on an accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative classical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible thermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational principle. We present the nonconservative action for a Navier-Stokes fluid including the effects of viscous dissipation and heat diffusion, as well as an action that generates the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, which can be easily generalized to more realistic rheological models. We show that the nonconservative action can be derived as the classical limit of a more complete quantum theory.}

                          hydrology or image processing. A Gaussian random field is fully
                          characterised by its mean function and covariance operator. In more
                          complex models these can also be partially unknown. In this case we need
                          to handle a family of Gaussian random fields indexed with
                          hyperparameters. Sampling for a fixed configuration of hyperparameters
                          is already very expensive due to the nonlocal nature of many classical
                          covariance operators. Sampling from multiple configurations increases
                          the total computational cost severely. In this report we employ
                          parameterised Karhunen-Loeve expansions for sampling. To reduce the cost
                          we construct a reduced basis surrogate built from snapshots of
                          Karhunen-Loeve eigenvectors. In particular, we consider Matern-type
                          covariance operators with unknown correlation length and standard
                          deviation. We suggest a linearisation of the covariance function and
                          describe the associated online-offline decomposition. In numerical
                          experiments we investigate the approximation error of the reduced
                          eigenpairs. As an application we consider forward uncertainty
                          propagation and Bayesian inversion with an elliptic partial differential
                          equation where the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient is a
                          parameterised Gaussian random field. In the Bayesian inverse problem we
                          employ Markov chain Monte Carlo on the reduced space to generate samples
                          from the posterior measure. All numerical experiments are conducted in
                          2D physical space, with non-separable covariance operators, and finite
                          element grids with similar to 10(4 )degrees of freedom. (C) 2019

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of large-scale dynamical systems plays a fundamental role in studying a wide range of complex physical phenomena; however, the inherent large-scale nature of the models often leads to unmanageable demands on computational resources. Model reduction aims to reduce this computational burden by generating reduced models that are faster and cheaper to simulate, yet accurately represent the original large-scale system behavior. Model reduction of linear, nonparametric dynamical systems has reached a considerable level of maturity, as reflected by several survey papers and books. However, parametric model reduction has emerged only more recently as an important and vibrant research area, with several recent advances making a survey paper timely. Thus, this paper aims to provide a resource that draws together recent contributions in different communities to survey the state of the art in parametric model reduction methods.
              %
              Parametric model reduction targets the broad class of problems for which the equations governing the system behavior depend on a set of parameters. Examples include parameterized partial differential equations and large-scale systems of parameterized ordinary differential equations. The goal of parametric model reduction is to generate low-cost but accurate models that characterize system response for different values of the parameters. This paper surveys state-of-the-art methods in projection-based parametric model reduction, describing the different approaches within each class of methods for handling parametric variation and providing a comparative discussion that lends insights to potential advantages and disadvantages in applying each of the methods. We highlight the important role played by parametric model reduction in design, control, optimization, and uncertainty quantification-settings that require repeated model evaluations over different parameter values.}

Possible surrogate modeling techniques include data fits (local, multipoint, or global), multifidelity model hierarchies, and reduced-order models, and each of these types has unique features when employed within SBO. This paper explores a number of SBO algorithmic variations and their effect for different surrogate modeling cases. First, general facilities for constraint management are explored through approx- imate subproblem formulations (e.g., direct surrogate), constraint relaxation techniques (e.g., homotopy), merit function selections (e.g., augmented Lagrangian), and iterate ac- ceptance logic selections (e.g., filter methods). Second, techniques specialized to particular surrogate types are described. Computational results are presented for sets of algebraic test problems and an engineering design application solved using the DAKOTA software.}

              approximation to an eigenspace X of a general matrix A from a subspace W
              that contains an approximation to X. The method produces a pair (N, (X)
              over tilde) that purports to approximate a pair (L, X), where X is a
              basis for X and AX = XL. In this paper we consider the convergence of
              (N, (X) over tilde) as the sine epsilon of the angle between X and W
              approaches zero. It is shown that under a natural hypothesis - called
              the uniform separation condition - the Ritz pairs (N, (X) over tilde)
              converge to the eigenpair (L, X). When one is concerned with eigenvalues
              and eigenvectors, one can compute certain refined Ritz vectors whose
              convergence is guaranteed, even when the uniform separation condition is
              not satisfied. An attractive feature of the analysis is that it does not
              assume that A has distinct eigenvalues or is diagonalizable.}},

In this work we discuss the design of pyMOR, a freely available software library of model order reduction algorithms, in particular reduced basis methods, implemented with the Python programming language. As its main design feature, all reduction algorithms in pyMOR are implemented generically via operations on well-defined vector array, operator, and discretization interface classes. This allows for an easy integration with existing open-source high-performance partial differential equation solvers without adding any model reduction specific code to these solvers. Besides an in-depth discussion of pyMOR's design philosophy and architecture, we present several benchmark results and numerical examples showing the feasibility of our approach.}

  abstract = {A reduced-order model based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been presented and applied to solving eigenvalue problems. The model is constructed via the method of snapshots, which is based upon the singular value decomposition of a matrix containing the characteristics of a solution as it evolves through time. Part of the novelty of this work is in how this snapshot data are generated, and this is through the recasting of eigenvalue problem, which is time independent, into a time-dependent form. Instances of time-dependent eigenfunction solutions are therefore used to construct the snapshot matrix. The reduced order model's capabilities in efficiently resolving eigenvalue problems that typically become computationally expensive (using standard full model discretisations) has been demonstrated. Although the approach can be adapted to most general eigenvalue problems, the examples presented here are based on calculating dominant eigenvalues in reactor physics applications. The approach is shown to reconstruct both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions accurately using a significantly reduced number of unknowns in comparison with ‘full’ models based on finite element discretisations. The novelty of this paper therefore includes a new approach to generating snapshots, POD's application to large-scale eigenvalue calculations, and reduced-order model's application in reactor physics.},

              Nous présentons une méthode pour le calcul de bornes inférieures pour les constantes de stabilité (de coercivité ou d'inf–sup) nécessaires pour les estimateurs d'erreur a posteriori, associées à l'approximation par base réduite d'équations aux dérivées partielles ayant une dépendance affine en les paramétres. La méthode—basée sur une stratégie hors-ligne/en-ligne intéressante pour le calcul temps réel et les cas d'évaluations multiples—réduit le calcul en-ligne à un problème d'optimisation linéaire peu coûteux. La fonction objectif est un développement paramétrique du quotient de Rayleigh. Les contraintes traduisent la stabilité pour un ensemble optimal de paramétres. Nous présentons des résultats numériques pour un problème d'élasticité (coercif) ainsi que pour un problème d'acoustique de type Helmholtz (non-coercif). Pour citer cet article : D.B.P.

Both orthogonal-Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin methods are considered here with a special emphasis on nonselfadjoint problems, thus extending earlier studies by Chatelin, Babuška and Osborn, and Knyazev.

  abstract = {SUMMARYThe solution of inverse problems in cardiovascular mathematics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we apply a domain parametrization technique to reduce both the geometrical and computational complexities of the forward problem and replace the finite element solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations by a computationally less-expensive reduced-basis approximation. This greatly reduces the cost of simulating the forward problem. We then consider the solution of inverse problems both in the deterministic sense, by solving a least-squares problem, and in the statistical sense, by using a Bayesian framework for quantifying uncertainty. Two inverse problems arising in hemodynamics modeling are considered: (i) a simplified fluid–structure interaction model problem in a portion of a stenosed artery for quantifying the risk of atherosclerosis by identifying the material parameters of the arterial wall on the basis of pressure measurements; (ii) a simplified femoral bypass graft model for robust shape design under uncertain residual flow in the main arterial branch identified from pressure measurements.

  abstract = {SUMMARY Hessian-based model reduction was previously proposed as an approach in deriving reduced models for the solution of large-scale linear inverse problems by targeting accuracy in observation outputs. A control-theoretic view of Hessian-based model reduction that hinges on the equality between the Hessian and the transient observability gramian of the underlying linear system is presented. The model reduction strategy is applied to a large-scale ( degrees of freedom) three-dimensional contaminant transport problem in an urban environment, an application that requires real-time computation. In addition to the inversion accuracy, the ability of reduced models of varying dimension to make predictions of the contaminant evolution beyond the time horizon of observations is studied. Results indicate that the reduced models have a factor speedup in computing time for the same level of accuracy. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = { A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh–Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results. }

  abstract = {Abstract A Petrov–Galerkin projection method is proposed for reducing the dimension of a discrete non-linear static or dynamic computational model in view of enabling its processing in real time. The right reduced-order basis is chosen to be invariant and is constructed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method. The left reduced-order basis is selected to minimize the two-norm of the residual arising at each Newton iteration. Thus, this basis is iteration-dependent, enables capturing of non-linearities, and leads to the globally convergent Gauss–Newton method. To avoid the significant computational cost of assembling the reduced-order operators, the residual and action of the Jacobian on the right reduced-order basis are each approximated by the product of an invariant, large-scale matrix, and an iteration-dependent, smaller one. The invariant matrix is computed using a data compression procedure that meets proposed consistency requirements. The iteration-dependent matrix is computed to enable the least-squares reconstruction of some entries of the approximated quantities. The results obtained for the solution of a turbulent flow problem and several non-linear structural dynamics problems highlight the merit of the proposed consistency requirements. They also demonstrate the potential of this method to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with high-dimensional non-linear models while retaining their accuracy.

  abstract = {SUMMARYA rigorous computational framework for the dimensional reduction of discrete, high-fidelity, nonlinear, finite element structural dynamics models is presented. It is based on the pre-computation of solution snapshots, their compression into a reduced-order basis, and the Galerkin projection of the given discrete high-dimensional model onto this basis. To this effect, this framework distinguishes between vector-valued displacements and manifold-valued finite rotations. To minimize computational complexity, it also differentiates between the cases of constant and configuration-dependent mass matrices. Like most projection-based nonlinear model reduction methods, however, its computational efficiency hinges not only on the ability of the constructed reduced-order basis to capture the dominant features of the solution of interest but also on the ability of this framework to compute fast and accurate approximations of the projection onto a subspace of tangent matrices and/or force vectors. The computation of the latter approximations is often referred to in the literature as hyper reduction. Hence, this paper also presents the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) hyper reduction method for discrete (or semi-discrete), nonlinear, finite element structural dynamics models. Based on mesh sampling and the principle of virtual work, ECSW is natural for finite element computations and preserves an important energetic aspect of the high-dimensional finite element model to be reduced. Equipped with this hyper reduction procedure, the aforementioned Galerkin projection framework is first demonstrated for several academic but challenging problems. Then, its potential for the effective solution of real problems is highlighted with the realistic simulation of the transient response of a vehicle to an underbody blast event. For this problem, the proposed nonlinear model reduction framework reduces the CPU time required by a typical high-dimensional model by up to four orders of magnitude while maintaining a good level of accuracy.

The parameter dependence may be linear or nonlinear and is retained in the reduced-order model. Moreover, we are able to give conditions under which the gradient and Hessian of the system response with respect to the system parameters is matched in the reduced-order model. We provide a systematic approach built on established interpolatory \$\mathcal{H}\_2\$ optimal model reduction methods that will produce parameterized reduced-order models having high fidelity throughout a parameter range of interest. For single input/single output systems with parameters in the input/output maps, we provide reduced-order models that are optimal with respect to an \$\mathcal{H}\_2\otimes\mathcal{L}\_2\$ joint error measure. The capabilities of these approaches are illustrated by several numerical examples from technical applications. }
