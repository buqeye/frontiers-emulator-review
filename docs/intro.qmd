# Introduction

## Motivation

Emulators---fast numerical models that approximate the expensive *simulator*---can open the door to a wide range of techniques and applications in nuclear physics. Otherwise impractical calculations could be emulated with fewer computational resources.
These are timely developments, as nuclear simulations are being pushed toward larger masses, within unstable regimes, and using sophisticated Bayesian methods.
But the nuclear physics community has not scratched the surface of the types of emulators that could be crafted or explored their full range of applications.
Key to the broader adoption of these tools is both the evangelization of their potential and pedagogical guides for those first starting in this field.
This review is aimed at achieving both of these goals.

To do so, we have created a rather unconventional document comprised of both a static, published PDF, which you are reading now, along with a corresponding website containing supplemental material and all code that generates the results.
Interested individuals can dynamically generate different versions of the document based on tunable parameters.
We hope that this format both encourages readers to experiment and build upon the examples presented here, and enables new applications.

Emulators come in a variety of flavors which can be categorized according to multiple schemes.
One useful taxonomy places emulators on a spectrum of data-driven to model-driven.
Data-driven emulators can treat the exact simulator results as a black box and build an emulator from its predictions.
Model driven emulators instead take the governing (differential) equations as given, from which the emulator is derived as a low order approximation.

Some variants of data driven emulators have been applied with success within nuclear physics.

On the other hand, although the theory of model driven emulators is quite mature, the adoption of such tools is still in its infancy in nuclear physics.

The remainder of this document is structured as follows.
@sec-model-reduction introduces the key concepts of model reduction used for deriving reduced-order models.
@sec-eigen-emulators derives reduced-order emulators for eigen-systems and contrasts these with alternative emulators in an example setting.
@sec-scattering-emulators continues with two scattering examples based on the Kohn and Newton variational principles.
