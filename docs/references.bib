  abstract = {It is demonstrated, contrary to various claims, that the phase shifts calculated via variational principles involving the Green function may exhibit anomalous behavior. These anomalies may appear in variational principles for the K matrix (Schwinger variational principle) of potential V, for (KV) (Kohn-type and Newton variational principles), and other variational principles of higher order (Takatsuka—McKoy variational principle).}
